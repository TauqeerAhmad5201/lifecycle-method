## Life cycle method 

Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.

The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.

Component Mounting Phase

### A component “mounts” when it renders for the first time. When a component mounts, it automatically calls these three methods, in the order of:

   - constructor()
   - render()
   -  componentDidUpdate()
